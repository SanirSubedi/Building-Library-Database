# ðŸ“š Library Management System

The Library Management System (LMS) is a database designed to efficiently manage library operations such as maintaining books, authors, employees, members, vendors, and donations.

The goal of this project is to create a structured relational database that supports library operations like book borrowing, vendor purchases, and donor tracking, ensuring accuracy, scalability, and integrity of data.

This project implements a **Library Management System** using SQL, designed to manage books, members, employees, vendors, and their relationships efficiently.  
The database follows principles of **Entityâ€“Relationship modeling**, **Normalization**, and **Referential Integrity**.

## ðŸ”— 2. Relationships

| Relationship | Type | Cardinality | Participation | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| Library â€“ Books | Strong | M:N | Library **total**, Book partial | A library can store many books; a book can belong to multiple libraries. |
| Library â€“ Vendor | Strong | M:N | Both partial | A library can order from multiple vendors. |
| Employee â€“ Library | Strong | N:1 | Employee **total**, Library partial | Each employee works in one library. |
| Employee â€“ Emp_Dependent | Weak | 1:N | Employee **total**, Dependent **total** | A dependent cannot exist without an employee. |
| Member â€“ Loan | Strong | N:1 | Loan **total**, Member partial | Each loan is issued to one member. |
| Book â€“ Author | Strong | M:N | Book **total**, Author partial | A book can have multiple authors; an author can write multiple books. |
| Library â€“ Donations | Strong | 1:N | Donation **total**, Library partial | Each donation is linked to one library. |

## DDL 
ïƒ¨	 DDL stands for Data Definition Language, a subset of SQL used to create, modify, and remove database objects like tables, schemas, and indexes. Its main purpose is to define the structure and schema of a database, rather than manipulating the data within it.


## DML 
ïƒ¨	A data manipulation language is a computer programming language used for adding, deleting, and modifying data in a database. A DML is often a sublanguage of a broader database language such as SQL, with the DML comprising some of the operators in the language.


For Code: [DDL and DML (Sql Code)](code.md)



## Queries 
ïƒ¨	A query is a request for information, or an action to be performed on data. It can be a simple question a person asks to get information, or a technical command sent to a database or search engine to retrieve specific data.

For Code: [10 SQL Queries](Queries.md)

## ðŸ“˜ 3. Normalization

To ensure **data consistency** and **minimal redundancy**, the database is normalized up to **Third Normal Form (3NF)**.

### **1NF â€“ First Normal Form**
- All attributes contain **atomic values**.
- Multivalued attributes (e.g., employee phone numbers, vendor contact numbers) are moved to separate tables:
  - `emp_mobile(emp_id, mob_no)`
  - `vendor_mobile(vendor_id, mobile_no)`
- Composite and repeating groups are eliminated.

### **2NF â€“ Second Normal Form**
- All **non-key attributes** are fully dependent on the **primary key**.
- Example: In `books`, `title`, `language`, and `publish_year` depend entirely on `book_id`.
- Junction tables (`book_author`, `buys`, `offer`) remove partial dependencies in M:N relationships.

### **3NF â€“ Third Normal Form**
- No **transitive dependencies**.
- Example: Employeeâ€™s library information is stored in `library`, not duplicated in `employee`.
- Vendor contact info is in `vendor_mobile`, preventing dependency chains.
- Each table focuses on one **logical concept** (Library, Employee, Vendor, etc.).

### âœ… **Normalization Summary**

| Normal Form | Achieved | Purpose |
|--------------|-----------|----------|
| 1NF | âœ… | Remove repeating groups and multivalued attributes |
| 2NF | âœ… | Remove partial dependencies |
| 3NF | âœ… | Remove transitive dependencies and ensure referential integrity |

The design ensures **data accuracy**, **integrity**, and **efficient updates** across all relationships.
