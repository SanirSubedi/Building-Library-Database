# 📚 Library Management System

The Library Management System (LMS) is a database designed to efficiently manage library operations such as maintaining books, authors, employees, members, vendors, and donations.

The goal of this project is to create a structured relational database that supports library operations like book borrowing, vendor purchases, and donor tracking, ensuring accuracy, scalability, and integrity of data.

This project implements a **Library Management System** using SQL, designed to manage books, members, employees, vendors, and their relationships efficiently.  
The database follows principles of **Entity–Relationship modeling**, **Normalization**, and **Referential Integrity**.


## 🧩 1. Entities and Attributes

| **Employee** | Emp_ID (PK), Name, Email, BOD, Sec, Lib_No (FK), Manager_ID (Self-FK) |
| **Member** | M_ID (PK), F_Name, L_Name, Email, Lib_No (FK) |
| **Loan** | Loan_ID (PK), Loan_Date, Return_Date, Member_ID (FK) |
| **Emp_Dependent** *(Weak Entity)* | Name, Sex, Emp_ID (FK) |
| **Donations** | Donator_ID (PK), Donator_Name, Donator_Email, Lib_No (FK) |
| **Vendor** | Vendor_ID (PK), Name, Email |
| **Emp_Mobile** *(Multivalued)* | Emp_ID (FK), Mob_No |
| **Vendor_Mobile** *(Multivalued)* | Vendor_ID (FK), Mobile_No |
| **Book_Author** *(M:N)* | Book_ID (FK), Author_ID (FK) |
| **Buys** *(M:N)* | Lib_No (FK), Vendor_ID (FK) |
| **Offer** *(M:N)* | Emp_ID (FK), Loan_ID (FK) |

## 🔗 2. Relationships

| Relationship | Type | Cardinality | Participation | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| Library – Books | Strong | M:N | Library **total**, Book partial | A library can store many books; a book can belong to multiple libraries. |
| Library – Vendor | Strong | M:N | Both partial | A library can order from multiple vendors. |
| Employee – Library | Strong | N:1 | Employee **total**, Library partial | Each employee works in one library. |
| Employee – Emp_Dependent | Weak | 1:N | Employee **total**, Dependent **total** | A dependent cannot exist without an employee. |
| Member – Loan | Strong | N:1 | Loan **total**, Member partial | Each loan is issued to one member. |
| Book – Author | Strong | M:N | Book **total**, Author partial | A book can have multiple authors; an author can write multiple books. |
| Library – Donations | Strong | 1:N | Donation **total**, Library partial | Each donation is linked to one library. |
| Library – Member | Strong | 1:N | Member **total**, Library partial | Each member belongs to one library. |

## 📘 3. Normalization

To ensure **data consistency** and **minimal redundancy**, the database is normalized up to **Third Normal Form (3NF)**.

### **1NF – First Normal Form**
- All attributes contain **atomic values**.
- Multivalued attributes (e.g., employee phone numbers, vendor contact numbers) are moved to separate tables:
  - `emp_mobile(emp_id, mob_no)`
  - `vendor_mobile(vendor_id, mobile_no)`
- Composite and repeating groups are eliminated.

### **2NF – Second Normal Form**
- All **non-key attributes** are fully dependent on the **primary key**.
- Example: In `books`, `title`, `language`, and `publish_year` depend entirely on `book_id`.
- Junction tables (`book_author`, `buys`, `offer`) remove partial dependencies in M:N relationships.

### **3NF – Third Normal Form**
- No **transitive dependencies**.
- Example: Employee’s library information is stored in `library`, not duplicated in `employee`.
- Vendor contact info is in `vendor_mobile`, preventing dependency chains.
- Each table focuses on one **logical concept** (Library, Employee, Vendor, etc.).

### ✅ **Normalization Summary**

| Normal Form | Achieved | Purpose |
|--------------|-----------|----------|
| 1NF | ✅ | Remove repeating groups and multivalued attributes |
| 2NF | ✅ | Remove partial dependencies |
| 3NF | ✅ | Remove transitive dependencies and ensure referential integrity |

The design ensures **data accuracy**, **integrity**, and **efficient updates** across all relationships.

### **Relationships & Multivalued Data**
- Employees may have multiple phone numbers.
- Vendors may serve multiple libraries.
- Books can have multiple authors.
- Loans are managed by employees through the *Offer* relationship.

## 🧱 7. Future Improvements
- Add **Views** for easy reporting (e.g., “Books by Author”, “Active Loans”).  
- Implement **Stored Procedures** for issuing/returning books.  
- Use **Triggers** for automatic updates on due dates or fine calculations.  
- Expand to **4NF/5NF** for separating independent multi-valued dependencies (if needed).
